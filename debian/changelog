ros-humble-adi-iio (1.0.0-1jammy) jammy; urgency=high

  * Automated Hardware Testing Infrastructure:
    
      * Setup of test workflows on self-hosted runners, with access to Pluto SDR device.
    
  * Added system test validation and documentation.
  * Examples and Documentation Enhancements:
    
      * Added examples for HWMON, AD5592R and AD7124_8 devices, showcasing service usage and buffer operations.
      * Documented service usage and examples for specific devices.
    
  * Code Quality and CI/CD updates:
    
      * Improved CI/CD workflows for building, testing, and linting.
      * Added pre-commit hooks for code style checks.
      * Enhanced documentation generation using adidoctools guidelines.
    
  * Service Interfaces:
    
      * Discovery Services:
        
          * ``ScanContext`` - Comprehensive IIO context scanning service that returns lists of devices, channels, and attributes formatted as IIO paths.
          * ``ListDevices`` - Lists all IIO device paths found in the current context.
          * ``ListChannels`` - Lists all channel paths for a specified device.
          * ``ListAttributes`` - Lists attribute paths for context, device, or channel targets.
        
      * Attribute Management Services:
        
          * ``AttrReadString`` - Reads string values from IIO attributes specified by path.
          * ``AttrWriteString`` - Writes string values to IIO attributes specified by path.
          * ``AttrEnableTopic`` - Enables real-time topic publishing for attributes with configurable data types (String, Int, Double, Bool) and update rates.
          * ``AttrDisableTopic`` - Disables topic publishing for specified attributes.
        
      * Buffer Operation Services:
        
          * ``BufferCreate`` - Initializes buffers for continuous data capture from specified device channels.
          * ``BufferDestroy`` - Stops buffer operations and releases associated resources.
          * ``BufferRead`` - Convenience service combining buffer destruction, creation, and data acquisition in one call.
          * ``BufferWrite`` - Pushes sample data to hardware devices with optional cyclic mode for repeated transmission.
          * ``BufferRefill`` - Transfers data from hardware device to client via Int32MultiArray response.
          * ``BufferEnableTopic`` - Initiates continuous data capture and publishes to associated topics.
          * ``BufferDisableTopic`` - Stops continuous buffer data transfer to topics.
        
    
  * Added launch file support for the Node.
  * Initial revision of the adi_iio package.
