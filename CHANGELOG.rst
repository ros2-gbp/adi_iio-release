* Service Interfaces:

  * Discovery Services:

    * ``ScanContext`` - Comprehensive IIO context scanning service that returns lists of devices, channels, and attributes formatted as IIO paths.
    * ``ListDevices`` - Lists all IIO device paths found in the current context.
    * ``ListChannels`` - Lists all channel paths for a specified device.
    * ``ListAttributes`` - Lists attribute paths for context, device, or channel targets.

  * Attribute Management Services:

    * ``AttrReadString`` - Reads string values from IIO attributes specified by path.
    * ``AttrWriteString`` - Writes string values to IIO attributes specified by path.
    * ``AttrEnableTopic`` - Enables real-time topic publishing for attributes with configurable data types (String, Int, Double, Bool) and update rates.
    * ``AttrDisableTopic`` - Disables topic publishing for specified attributes.

  * Buffer Operation Services:

    * ``BufferCreate`` - Initializes buffers for continuous data capture from specified device channels.
    * ``BufferDestroy`` - Stops buffer operations and releases associated resources.
    * ``BufferRead`` - Convenience service combining buffer destruction, creation, and data acquisition in one call.
    * ``BufferWrite`` - Pushes sample data to hardware devices with optional cyclic mode for repeated transmission.
    * ``BufferRefill`` - Transfers data from hardware device to client via Int32MultiArray response.
    * ``BufferEnableTopic`` - Initiates continuous data capture and publishes to associated topics.
    * ``BufferDisableTopic`` - Stops continuous buffer data transfer to topics.
